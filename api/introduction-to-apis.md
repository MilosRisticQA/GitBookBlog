# Introduction to APIs

## What is an API?

An **API**, or **Application Programming Interface**, provides a way for computer systems to interact with each other. There are many types of APIs. While the types of uses for APIs are vast, the one thing all APIs have in commons is **providing functionality for use by another program**.

## Web APIs

APIs that are built with web technologies and that work in a similar way to the web are often called **web APIs** or **HTTP APIs** because, like the web, they operate over HTTP. 

## Provider and Consumer

* An API **provider** \(**server**\) is the system that provides an API for other parties to use. 
* An API **consumer** \(**client**\) is the system that uses the API to accomplish some work.

## Usage

* APIs allow sharing data between systems.
* Many modern web applications provide an API that allows developers to integrate their own code with these applications, taking advantage of the services' functionality in their own apps.
