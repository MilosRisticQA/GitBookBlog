# Welcome page

This tiny space on the web will be manly focused on automation testing practices and solutions based on variety different resources such as blogs, books, video courses, podcasts and wise advise I got from professional developers I've been lucky to meet.?

Here you'll find topics about basics of Object Oriented Paradigm in different programming languages used in test automation frameworks covering both Client and Server side, meaning there will be talk about testing of web services, API and databases and also how do we approach to testing of web UI by using different automation testing tools.

Also, as setting up environments and configuration files as infrastructure for our projects is very important be ready for quite a bit of screenshots from both Windows and Linux‚ù§ ecosystems followed by necessary commands presented in code blocks. 

Since our main focus will be software testing, it's always important to remind ourselves of testing fundamentals so you'll find valuable materials here as well.

For your reference, under each section there'll be a page dedicated to resources I mentioned at the beginning.



_P.S. I hope some of this might help you as well, dear reader, in your future projects._

Sincerely,  
M.
