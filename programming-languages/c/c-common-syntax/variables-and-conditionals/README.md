# Variables and Conditionals

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Variable**: a name given to a storage location in memory._
{% endhint %}

C\# operators tell the computer _**what programmer want to do**_. In other words, operators are VERBS and not descriptors. 

The equals symbol **`=`** is called the _**assignment operator** and it takes the value on its **RIGHT** and **stores it i**n the variable on the **LEFT.**_
