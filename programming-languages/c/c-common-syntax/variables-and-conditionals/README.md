# Variables and Conditionals

_**Constant**_ is a value that _**cannot be changed.**_ We use constants when we need to ensure that a value does not change.

A variable is a name that represents data stored in memory during program execution. We use variables to store _**temporary values**_ in memory.

| Variable name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Local variable** | Holds temporary data within the scope of a method. Not a member of a type. |
| **Field** | Holds data associated with a type or an instance of a type. **Member of a type.** |
| **Parameter** | A temporary variable used to pass data from one method to another method. Not a member of a type. |
| **Array element** | One member of a sequenced collection of \(usually\) homogeneous data items. Can be **either local or a member of a type.** |

### Declaring a variable































C\# operators tell the computer _**what programmer want to do**_. In other words, operators are _**VERBS**_ and not descriptors. 

The equals symbol **`=`** is called the _**assignment operator** and it takes the value on its **RIGHT** and **stores it i**n the variable on the **LEFT.**_
