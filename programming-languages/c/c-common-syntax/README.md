# C\#: Common Syntax

> _C\# program is a related set of **type declarations**._

Type is a **template** for creating _**data structures. It is defined by the following elements:**_

* a _**Name**_
* a Data structure to contain its _**data members**_
* _**Behaviors**_ and _**constrains**_

_**Instantiating the type**_ is creating an actual object from the type's template:

* The object created by instantiating a type is called either an _**Object** of the type_ or an _**Instance** of the type._
* _Every data item_ is an **instance of some type** provided by: the language; the BCL \(Base Class Library\) or another library; or defined by the programmer.

Types can store:

* **single** data item: Simple types
* **multiple** data items of _the same type_ - individual data items are called _**Elements**_ referenced by _numbers_
* **multiple** data items of _many different types_ - individual data items are called _**Members**_ referenced by _names_
