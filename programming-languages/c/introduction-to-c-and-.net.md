# Introduction to C\# and .NET

## Understanding .NET and .NET Core

.NET is a framework that can take our C\# code and tell the computer what to do with it. There are two different versions of .NET:

* .NET Framework 
  * works only on Windows machines
  * supported only by Microsoft developers;
* .NET Core
  * works on Windows, Linux, Mac and from version 3.0 on Raspberry Pi and ARM chips
  * open source and supported by both Microsoft and non-Microsoft developers;

Two main components of .NET are

1. CLR - Common Language _**Runtime**_

   Runtime provides a space for us to run our program in C\# hence to manage memory for it and send instructions to CPU.

2. FCL - Framework Class _**Library**_ _\(also Base Class Library\)_

   It provides a library of code that is already written and tested by Microsoft and non-Microsoft developers

These components are included in SDK \(Software Development Kit\).
